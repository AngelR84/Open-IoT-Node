WebSite: [http://OpenIoTNode.com][REfOpenIoTNode]

Open IoT Node is an Open project sponsored by Guapu Technologies.
The goal of this project is to create an Open Hardware and Software Platform (OHSP) compatibles with the different standards present on the market: HomeKit, Google On, etc,

## Technologies

This project is based in three Radio Frequency technologies to provide a valid solution for different scenarios:

* Bluetooth Low Energy: Near range (up to 100m), Low bit rate (up to 2Mb/s), Ultra efficient power consumption (up to 15mA)
* WiFi: Near rage (up to 300m), High bit Rate (up to 300Mb/s)
* LoRa: Long range (up to 30Km), Ultra Low bit rate (up to 300kb/s), Ultra efficient power consumption (up to 100mA)

## Wireless Connectivity

* BLE Mode compatible with: iBeacon, Estimote, Eddystone, AltBeacon
* Machine To Machine (M2M)
* Mesh Network

## Onboard Connectivity

*1 x i2C
*1 x UART
*1 x SPI

##Expansion Boards

* GPS
* GSM/3G
* Sensors Array
* Solar Power + Battery
