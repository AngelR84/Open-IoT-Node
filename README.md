Open IoT Node PCB is an Open Source Hardware project sponsored by [Guapu Technologies][RefGuapuTechnologies].
The goal of this project is to create an Open Hardware and Software Platform (OHSP) compatibles with the different standards present on the market: HomeKit, Google On, etc,

## Technologies

This project is based in three Radio Frequency technologies to provide a valid solution for different scenarios:

* Bluetooth Low Energy: Near range (up to 100m), Low bit rate (up to 2Mb/s), Ultra efficient power consumption (up to 15mA)
* WiFi: Near rage (up to 300m), High bit Rate (up to 300Mb/s)
* LoRa: Long range (up to 30Km), Ultra Low bit rate (up to 300kb/s), Ultra efficient power consumption (up to 100mA)

## Wireless Connectivity

* BLE Mode compatible with: iBeacon, Estimote, Eddystone, AltBeacon
* Machine To Machine (M2M)
* Mesh Network

## Onboard Connections

* +1 x i2C
* +1 x UART
* +1 x SPI

##Extras

* GPS
* GSM/3G
* Sensors Array
* Solar Power + Battery
